    The solution will deploy the needed Azure infrastructure for SAP Netweaver and SAP HANA
    and provision and configure the virtual machines and install the SAP application for you.

    As SAP sizing can be complex, a simplified sizing approach is used.
    With the well known concept of T-Shirt sizes S,M,L we provide a simple way of using different settings.

    Behind such T-Shirt sizes, we use the right Azure instance and the needed number of disks with the right size.
    The Demo and S size are thought for non-production, the M and L will use SAP certified instance types and can be used for production scenarios.
    Below is a rought estimation about the SAPS behind the three sizes:

    * Small  <  30.000 SAPS
    * Medium <  70.000 SAPS
    * Large  < 180.000 SAPS

    **Please be aware that it may require a high amount of resources, therefore an increase of your quota could be necessary**.

    Read the **Pre-requirements** and **Setting up the Storage account** chapters to understand how to use the SAP installation software.

    For a more advanced customization you will need to get your hands dirty and work directly with the source project: https://github.com/SUSE/ha-sap-terraform-deployments
